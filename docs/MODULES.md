# MODULES.md

The module catalog: purpose, responsibilities, dependencies, key events, and MVP scope for each
module. Boundaries and communication rules are in ARCHITECTURE.md and INTEGRATION_EVENTS.md.

> Dependency note: "depends on" means consumes another module's **contract or events** — never
> its tables (ADR-0007).
